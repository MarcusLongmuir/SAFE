SAFE is a minimal routing layer on top of jQuery. It's easy to learn and lets anyone that knows jQuery create modern web apps without the need for an opinionated framework.

The SuperAwesome Front End (SAFE) framework allows you to easily create a web front end that has the following functionality:

* Instant page loading (using HTML5 history), falling back to conventional loading where unsupported.

* Animated transitions between pages.

* Javascript resize events sent through hierarchy.

To achieve this, SAFE-powered sites are written in Javascript (that generates elements) rather than HTML. The intention is for all of the site's code to be object-oriented and well structured.
