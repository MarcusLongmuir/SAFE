The SuperAwesome Front End (SAFE) framework allows you to easily create a web front end that has the following functionality:

* Instant page loading (using HTML5 history), falling back to conventional loading where unsupported.

* Transitions between pages.

* Javascript resize events sent through hierarchy.

To achieve this, SAFE-powered sites are written in Javascript (that generates elements) rather than HTML. The intention is for all of the site's code to be object-oriented and well structured.
